2. Read this glossary about [MLops](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/mlops)
3. Search what tools we have in the TS. You don't need to know how they work, just what they do in a general sense. You'll get a deep dive into them in the future.
4. What do we currently provide in the cloud?
5. What parts of the workflow we didn't provide? Which tools can be used to fufill their purpose?
6. What's the ideal workflow for a data scientist to work, what role do we fill in their workflow as a team?

### Key Concepts:
- Main workflow of ML
- Devops vs Mlops

### Final Exercise:
- Build a theoretical MLOps pipeline and present it to the team. In your presentation you will need to explain what product you chose for each part and why you chose it.
