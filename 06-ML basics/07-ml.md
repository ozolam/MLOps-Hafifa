# Machine Learning
I hope you like buzzwords because this is the hottest field in the hi-tech industry these days.
This section is a small introduction to an unbelievably huge field, so it is extremely recommended to
read more about this subject. 


### TODO:
1.  introduction:

   Do lessons:
    * 2 - Intruduction to Neural Networks
    * 4 - Intruduction to Pytorch
    * 5 - Convolutional Neural Networks
    
    The rest is a bonus you can do on your own time (Highly reccomended)

### Final Exercise:
Try use everything you have learned to make the most accurate avocado price prediction model you can!

- Create a model that predicts avocado prices, using the dataset in this folder.
    - Use an interactive job in RunAI
- Train your model in a training job
    - Upload your model weight files to an S3 bucket as part of the train job.
