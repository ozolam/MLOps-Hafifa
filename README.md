# MLOps-Hafifa
# 👋 Welcome to the MLOps Team!

So... you joined the MLOps squad. Congrats! 🎉  
You’re now part of the mysterious group that keeps ML stuff from setting the company on fire.

This doc won’t make you an expert. It won’t even make you mildly dangerous.  
It’s just here to give you a **vibe check** on what we do, what MLOps is, and how we make data science *actually work*.

## 🤔 Wait... what even *is* MLOps?

MLOps = Machine Learning + DevOps + a healthy dose of chaos control.

In plain English:
- Data scientists want to train models 🧠
- Engineers want things to not crash 🔧
- We sit in the middle and make both happen 🤝

SO have fun and start learning!
